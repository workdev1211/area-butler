        <h2>§6 Contract Duration and Termination</h2>
        <ol>
          <li data-start="6">
            The contract duration is determined by the selected duration option for the respective subscription plan. This also applies to any minimum contract durations and notice periods. The right to extraordinary termination in the cases provided for by law remains unaffected for both parties.
          </li>
          <li data-start="6">
            If the user is given the opportunity under the contract to initially use AreaButler free of charge for a specific duration, the user can terminate the contract during this period at any time without giving reasons by means of a clear declaration to KuDiBa. The minimum contract duration and corresponding notice periods will apply from this point according to the chosen duration option. The initial minimum contract duration for the Business+ subscription is 3 months. The Pay-Per-Use options have no minimum contract duration.
          </li>
          <li data-start="6">
            The contract duration will automatically extend for the subscription period specified for the respective duration option unless the user terminates their contract within the applicable notice period before its expiration. The Pay-Per-Use options have no minimum contract duration.
          </li>
          <li data-start="6">
            In the "Monthly" duration option, the subscription period is one month. After the end of the current subscription period, the contract duration will automatically extend by another month unless the user terminates the contract with a two-week notice period prior to the end of the current subscription period by declaring it to KuDiBa.
          </li>
          <li data-start="6">
            In the "Annual" duration option, the subscription period is one year. After the end of the current subscription period, the contract duration will automatically extend for another year unless the user terminates the contract with a notice period of one month prior to the end of the current subscription period by declaring it to KuDiBa.
          </li>
          <li data-start="6">
            If KuDiBa provides a fillable online form for contract termination in the user area of AreaButler, the user is also permitted to terminate the contract using this form. Otherwise, the contract termination must be declared in writing, with text form (email) being sufficient.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>§7 Prices and Payment Terms</h2>
        <ol>
          <li data-start="7">
            The prices and contents of the subscription plans are based on the valid price information and product descriptions on the website at the time of the contract conclusion. All prices include the statutory value-added tax.
          </li>
          <li data-start="7">
            KuDiBa may, to a reasonable extent, but no more than ten percent annually, adjust the prices for ongoing subscription plans for future effectiveness in accordance with the development of the total costs associated with AreaButler that underlie price calculation (total costs). The total costs consist primarily of the costs for operating, further developing, and maintaining AreaButler and the website, customer support costs, energy costs, administrative costs, marketing expenses, rents, interest, and taxes as well as other levies. KuDiBa is entitled to increase prices accordingly in the event of rising total costs, with cost reductions being taken into account in calculating the total costs. KuDiBa will inform the user of such a price increase in a timely manner at least in text form. In the event of a price increase of more than seven percent for the subscription plan and subscription period booked by them, the user may terminate the contract extraordinarily within a period of seven days after receiving the information about the price increase, effective at the end of the current subscription period; text form (email) is sufficient.
          </li>
          <li data-start="7">
            The price for the agreed subscription plan is to be paid in advance for the selected subscription period.
          </li>
          <li data-start="7">
            Payment options available for the subscription plans are those offered at the time of the contract conclusion on AreaButler. KuDiBa reserves the right to expand or restrict the payment methods offered (including for individual subscription plans or services) at any time.
          </li>
          <li data-start="7">
            In the event of delayed payment, KuDiBa reserves the right to exclude the user from using AreaButler until the outstanding amount is paid. The obligation of the user to pay the fee during the withholding remains unaffected.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>§8 User Obligations</h2>
        <ol>
          <li data-start="8">
            The user is not permitted to make the analyses generated with AreaButler and related documents available to third parties for use, whether for a fee or free of charge. Interested parties of the user are not considered third parties.
          </li>
          <li data-start="8">
            The user remains obligated to pay the fee for the agreed duration, even if the required authorization to engage in their business ceases for whatever reason after the conclusion of the contract or it is established that the corresponding business license was not present at the time of the contract conclusion.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>§9 Maintenance and Further Development</h2>
        <ol>
          <li data-start="9">
            KuDiBa is entitled to further develop the functions, contents, and appearance of AreaButler according to the state of technology and within the scope of market standards while considering the interests of its users.
          </li>
          <li data-start="9">
            If technical disruptions occur that impair the use of AreaButler, KuDiBa will eliminate these as soon as it becomes aware of them, within the limits of its technical capabilities.
          </li>
          <li data-start="9">
            During technical disruptions or when necessary security or maintenance work is performed, the use of AreaButler may be temporarily restricted or impossible. Maintenance work will take place to the extent possible during off-peak hours. KuDiBa will inform the user of planned maintenance work in advance.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>§10 Liability</h2>
        <p>
          KuDiBa is liable for any damages that the user suffers in connection with AreaButler exclusively according to the following principles:{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          In cases of intent or gross negligence, as well as in the presence of a guarantee, liability is unlimited. In cases of slight negligence, liability is also unlimited in case of infringement of life, body, or health. In the case of a slight negligent violation of essential contractual obligations (obligations which enable the proper execution of the contract and on whose compliance the contractual partner relies and may rely), liability is limited to material and asset damages that are foreseeable and typically occurring. Any further liability for damages, except for claims under product liability law, is excluded.
        </p>
        <h2>§11 Data Protection</h2>
        <p>
          The processing of personal data of the user provided during registration, execution, and use of the platform and services, as well as the generated personal data, is governed by our statements regarding{" "}

        </p>
        <h2>§12 Applicable Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
        <ol>
          <li data-start="12">
            The legal relationships between KuDiBa and the user in connection with the use of AreaButler are subject to German law to the exclusion of the UN Sales Convention.
          </li>
          <li data-start="12">
            The exclusive place of performance and jurisdiction for disputes between KuDiBa and the user in connection with AreaButler is Hamburg, provided the user is a merchant or a legal entity under public law or a public law special fund. The same applies if the user has no general jurisdiction in Germany or the EU or if their residence or habitual residence is not known at the time of the filing of the lawsuit.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>§13 Amendment of these Terms and Conditions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li data-start="13">
            AreaButler reserves the right to amend these terms and conditions at any time, taking into account the legitimate interests of the user and maintaining a reasonable notice period of at least fifteen days. The announcement will be made by notification of the amended terms and conditions by email, stating the time of the effectiveness of the changes and their reason.
          </li>
          <li data-start="13">
            The user is entitled to terminate the contract in text form (email) with effect from the expiration of fifteen days after receipt of the notification according to § 14.1 during the above-mentioned period, unless a shorter period applies to the contract. If they fail to terminate, the amended terms and conditions will be deemed accepted. The announcement of the change will specifically mention the right to terminate and the importance of the notice period. Upon such termination, the user has no right to (partial) reimbursement of the price paid for the current subscription period.
          </li>
          <li data-start="13">
            The user can waive the notice period according to § 13.1 at any time after receiving the notification. Making analysis requests on AreaButler before the expiration of the notice period according to § 13.1 counts as a clear confirming action of such a waiver.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>§14 Final Provisions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li data-start="14">
            Oral side agreements in the form of amendments, additions, and supplements to this contract require written agreement for their effectiveness. The same applies to a waiver of the requirement for written form itself.
          </li>
          <li data-start="14">
            If any provision of these terms of use should be invalid, the validity of the other provisions shall not be affected thereby. The statutory provisions shall take the place of any invalid clause.
